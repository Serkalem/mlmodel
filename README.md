This repository contains tuned machine learning model for detection of Rheumatic heart disease and data set that was used for model building. 
The data set contains a categorical and integer type 20 attributes and 1500 instances. 
"The aim of the model building is to distinguish between the presence and absence of Rheumatic heart disease and to classify it in one of the 2 groups."

The main idea of this data set is to build a machine learning classification model for decision support system, which
will perform the detection of Rheumatic heart disease. Rheumatic heart disease is a condition in which the heart valves have been permanently damaged by rheumatic fever. The heart valve damage may start shortly after untreated or under-treated streptococcal infection such as strep throat or scarlet fever. An immune response causes an inflammatory condition in the body which can result in on-going valve damage. 

Data set:
The data was collected from medical examination by a medical expert as a heart disease historical data set and used for model building and test the model in classifying the disease.  The basis for detection of the disease was the international heart disease guideline and labeled to categorical and integer values.

Model:
The model was built through machine learning classification techniques. The python Preprocessing, feature engineering and Hyperparameter tuning techniques was implemented for getting accurate result.
